      <strong>SpeakOut</strong> is a public grievance redressal platform that empowers citizens to raise their voices
      against issues in their surroundings. From potholes and water shortages to safety concerns and local misconduct,
      SpeakOut ensures every concern is acknowledged and directed to the right authorities.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4 text-success">What You Can Do Here</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 Submit grievances along with image proof</li>
      <li>📍 Mention exact location details for better action</li>
      <li>📊 Track the real-time status of your complaints</li>
      <li>💬 Receive updates, comments, and support from others</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="mt-4 text-success">Why SpeakOut?</h5>
    <p>
      We believe that change begins with awareness. Many problems go unresolved not because they’re unsolvable — but
      because they’re unheard. SpeakOut bridges that gap. It gives a voice to those who care about their community and
      want to be part of the solution.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4 text-success">Our Vision</h5>
    <p>
      To create a transparent and responsive environment where citizens and officials work hand in hand toward a better
      tomorrow. SpeakOut is more than a portal — it's a movement.

        Your voice matters. Whether it's a broken streetlight or a major issue in your area — speak out. Each report you
        file is a step toward accountability, improvement, and change. Don’t wait for someone else to raise it. Be the
        one who did.
